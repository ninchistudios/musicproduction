# Music Production End to End Checklist

Don't over-write and over-produce. One finished, released song is better than a hundred half-assed attempts.

## Songwriting & Arrangement

### Structure

* Ensure the listener can instinctively know where they are in the arc of the song. Tell a story.

### Hook & Chorus

* The hook is one of the key ingredients of a memorable song
* It's possible to start writing a song from one phrase or word that forms the hook
* A statement? "F You". A Question? "Don't You Want Me Baby?" A Call to action? "Stay With Me"
* Sometimes people don't want d&m - sometimes just have fun. An exclamation? "Whoaaaa Livin' On A Prayer"
* Get to the chorus inside 30-45 sec
* Try to keep the 1st/2nd chorus identical. Don't break them out of something they've just learned to sing.
* Consider 2 choruses at the end, to drill the hook into them.
* Let the main hook be the last thing they hear?
* Contrast is good but don't change it to the point it's unrecognisable
* Consider a contrasting chord just before a hook to draw attention to it

### Lyrics

* Avoid cliche
* Songwriting references e.g. [Writing Better Lyrics](https://www.amazon.com.au/Writing-Better-Lyrics-Pat-Pattison-ebook/dp/B008Y0XH1C)

### Melody

Consider a Mode that suits the feel of the song, e.g.

1. Ionian (natural Major): Bright and happy, can be overly saccharine. Suits pop, rock, jazz, punk, country.
2. Dorian (natural Minor with a sharp 6th): Cheeky, partly sad, hopeful. Suits blues, jazz, rock, funk, prog.
3. Phrygian (natural Minor with a flat 2nd): Dark and tense. Spanish/oriental, suits metal, jazz, flamenco.
4. Lydian (natural Major with a sharp 4th): Mystical. Mostly used in jazz.
5. Mixolydian (natural Major with a flat 7th): Positive but edgy. Rock, blues, jazz, funk. The AC/DC progression.
6. Aeolian (natural Minor): Sad, subdued. Suits most genres.
7. Locrian (natural Major with flat 2nd and flat 5th): Dissonant, unstable, tense. 

Important to create a memorable melody.

* High freqs attract more attention, so consider melodic contour:
  * Verse: sea level
  * Pre-chorus/bridge: climbing
  * Chorus: Mountaintop - amaze them

### Chord Progression

* People love simple
* It's tempting to try complex and unique chord progressions, but people enjoy basic "four chords and the truth" as much as unique stuff

### Arranging

* Start with the biggest chorus, and work back from there, stripping away elements
* If possible, start with a rough vocal so that you have the flow of the song and energy
* Double/triple keys, with octaves and a mix of instruments, delay & reverb (e.g. high airy notes with lots of verb) 
* Try to include something surprising or unique in the arrangement to create interest. Take the listener on a journey.
* The song should grab the listener in the first verse/chorus, but don't give the listener everything. There should be some buildup/freshness, or the song will disappoint over time.
* Repetition is ok with a good arrangement. Even if the lyrics repeat, the arrangement should change and progress and stay fresh and interesting from section to section.
* The vocal is the most restrictive element of the arrangement. Ensure that it's set for the vocalist's sweet spot, even if every other instrument needs to be transposed.
* Rule of 3: no more than 3 melodic phrases at once to avoid crowded and confused tracks
* use silences and instrument swaps
* stack elements doing the same melody (e.g. vocal and lead) for a full effect

![Vocal Map](https://i.imgur.com/MjjWiBh.jpg "Vocal Map")

Some techniques:

* Vocal harmonies
* Vocal effects (radio/lofi, ring mod, etc)
* Percussion (bells, shakers etc)
* Synth instruments
* Strings and other orchestrals
* Doubled/tripled vocals
* Doubled guitars
* Time signature or tempo changes
* Key changes
* Quiet/highly simplified sections
* hold instruments out to make them more impactful when they come in (e.g. bass on Radiohead's Airbag)
* call and response with 2 instruments playing off each other

#### Better Basslines

* Perfect 4th (5 semis) & 5th (7 semis) intervals can be boring & weak - break these up with a short/gracenote
* Use motifs - a recognisable pattern
* Use syncopation (accented off-beat notes) and/or polyrhythms
* Uproot root notes (judiciously) as basslines with all root notes can be dull
* Octaves can work on basslines, including uprooting roots
* Use rests to both give a phrase a break, and build anticipation for the next section
* Try chromatic runs from the tonic to the third

#### 80s Synthwave Style - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b11zvQ737rc

* Polyphonic chords - use two notes on the left hand (maybe an octave) and four on the right, spread out for a classic 80s feel
* Don't overcomplicate - 80s mixers were limited on tracks
* The John Carpenter effect - simple droning bass, arp bass lines, simple diatonic melodies and synth fx hits/stabs

#### Better Chords

* Revoice & use inversions
* Add voices - e.g. the tonic and fifth
* spend time picking the right sound/synth
* try a different articulation - rather than whole notes, use dotted notes or other timings (noting the dynamics of the sound/synth)
* layer different sounds
* dress the chords up, e.g. with transients an octave up

## Production & Recording

* Mic placement is more important than mic choice.
* The analogue advice of recording at the highest possible level without clipping doesn't apply to digital. Record at -18dBFS on a VU without clipping.
* Don't "fix it in the mix" - originate the highest possible quality recordings.
* Lay down final MIDI arrangements if possible rather than placeholder. 
* Record MIDI notes with instruments (MIDI keys/pads/drums etc) rather than drawing notes if possible to humanise.
* Watch mic bleed from ambient sound and/or headphones when recording. Closed back cans preferred for vocalists.
* 3:1 rule for multi-micing: the 2nd mic should be 3x the distance from the 1st mic as the 1st mic is from the source. This helps prevent phase issues.

### Basic Order for Rock

1. click track at target tempo
2. Section Markers
3. Drums (not rough, but not final)
4. Melody/key reference e.g. rough vocal or acoustic guitar
5. Rhythm Guitar
6. Bass
7. Lead instruments
8. Vocals
11. Others

### RR Process (specifically for away/studio time, but some relevance to home recording)

1. Make a list of every track you want to record
2. Know what gear you need for the whole recording
3. Block out the time - 2 days for an EP, 4 days for an album if everything is prepped and rehearsed
4. Set up session - click/metronome, tempo, tracks and routing, markers, scratch track
5. Drums first - always - and multiple takes if using live drums
6. Bass instruments next
7. Core rhythm instruments - e.g. keys and guitars which carry the chord progression
8. Lead instruments
9. Lead vocals (3 full takes)
10. Backing vocals to the best take
11. other instruments

## Editing & Mixing

### Edit

1. Gain stage tracks to 0dB VU (max -6dBFS s - reduce all gain staging the same if any tracks peak the mix over -6).
2. Create composite track from all takes for each track.
3. Clean up, tighten up and tune up each track.
4. Tune vocals.
5. Clean up breaths, smacks and plosives.
6. Quantize instruments judiciously - don't overdo and dehumanise it. Drums/bass can take/need more quantization than others.
* basic levelling against pink noise https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_iZQEBuyGQ
* don't over-correct pitch/timing, it needs to be human.

### Mix

* save a mixdown before each session so that you can listen to how it was before you started
* Balance > Fix > Enhance > Shape > Space
* Make sure the signal isn't clipping from one plugin to the next. This might not be visible on the master bus, but it will be audible.
* The instruments should sound right & professional. Use reference. "People come for the sound and stay for the story".
* If it sounds radio ready, it's good
* If you can't hear it, delete it (noting poor hearing)

#### General Tips

* Keep the Master bus clear (VU, SPAN, Monitoring and Loudness Meter only) so that the reference track is unaffected. Use a Mix Bus to glue the mix.
* Generally mix at conservative volume, and check the mix at very low volume to make sure it still sounds ok. Volume distorts perception of the mix quality. However, the mix should improve with volume rather than the opposite - people tend to turn up as a track gains their attention. Equal loudness curves will show you what will gain more presence as the listener turns up (TLDR: Bass).
* Consider mixing the most important (e.g. the big energetic section, final chorus etc) section first and taking the rest of the mix from that.
* Mix the most important instrument - the one that most defines the song - first.
* Automate volume before you think about compression
* Sidechaining a track with extreme EQ/compression creates the ability to blend that to taste rather than just straight effects on the track. 
* Think about the space each instrument is in, and the emotion you want to convey. Large/small, low or high ceiling, wood/concrete/glass/fabric surfaces, is the instrument (incl vocals) excited/lonely/etc. 
* Don't solo instruments, you need to hear them in the context of the mix. Use a gain plugin instead.

#### Gain Staging with Basic Bus Layout

![Gain Staging with Basic Buses](https://github.com/ninchistudios/musicproduction/blob/master/gain-stage-buses.png "Gain Staging with Basic Buses")

#### Key Mixing Steps

* Create stereo buses as above or as desired.
* Gain stage as above or as desired.
* Lowend Bus balance: with Drum Bus gained to -3dB VU on the kick, a simultaneous bass and kick hit should kiss 0dB VU on the Lowend Bus.
* Add a very conservative glue compressor/reverb on the Mix Bus.
* Bring in a professionally mastered track that sounds similar to what you're aiming for.
* Gain down the reference track so it VUs at a similar level as the Mix Bus.
* Volume and Pan as below

#### Specific Track/Effect Mixing Tips

##### Drums

* Use a signal generator (e.g. Tone Gate in Reaper), gated from the specific drum track, to add meat to a drum. ~50Hz works ok for a kick or tune it to your kick & the song's tonic.
* Tape saturation can sound great on drums to give them a warm compression.
* Gate out drums between hits to create headroom/clarity and remove mud. 
* Very high compression with a long release on a drum room mic can add a nice meat to a drum mix when blended judiciously. EQ may be needed after the compressor to cut anything annoying.
* Cutting the close drums to room mic only during a song's quiet/low break can create good energy when the break ends.
* pre-delay can embiggen a snare and make it sound less unnatural by smoothing the decay wash.
* Check phase issues using monitors (not cans) and/or summing to mono
* a wide-q notch cut at ~500Hz on the drum bus is often useful
* Distortion or LoFi on a snare might help it sound better in the mix
* EQ Snares:

![EQ For Snares](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7746755/152644785-b716eb30-f4fd-4e86-9a74-12613ec2a0e0.png)

##### Bass Guitar

* Compress bass to give consistent volume and punch
* Subtle bass saturation/distortion on a sidechain and blended in will fatten up a bassline. Reduce lowend freqs on the sidechain as it gets dirtier - emphasise mids.
* Try an amp/cab sim on DI or MIDI bass to improve tone.
* Opposite EQ on kick & bass (~60Hz Bass boost + ~120Hz Bass cut) can help to separate them

##### Acoustic Guitar

* slow attack/fast release compression is best for acoustics. This allows the strums through but allows a subtle boosting of the ringout tone
* Multiple mics and/or doubling/tripling with LCR helps add sparkle and warmth

##### Electric Guitar

* Almost always double/triple LCR rhythm electrics. 

##### Piano/Keys

* Wide stereo keys are great for keys/vocal heavy music, but the more complex the mix, the more you probably need keys in mono so they have space in the mix.

##### Vocals

* Sidechain and pan a 1/4 note delay with a low pass filter to give a nice space and ambience without a washy reverb
* Hard pan widened doubled harmonies to add huge presence
* Vocal stutter on a long drawn out phrase by slicing (e.g. on 16ths/32nds) and muting.
* Telephone/lofi vocals with EQ with low+high pass filters, and boost the nice midtone. Maybe use on a delay.
* De-ess every vocal to remove annoying sibilance. 
* Use a stereo slapback delay bus to make vocals more natural and less dry. Low repetitions and small (up to 50ms) difference between L and R)
* Use a vocal only break to create great energy, e.g. https://youtu.be/kT8cX2-_7pQ?t=234
* Use subtle vocal distortion, morphoder/whisper and octave down to add presence e.g. https://youtu.be/syudb_B1x_A?t=1094

##### Automation

* Judiciously mute tracks when they're not adding something that's needed
* Automate the fader as an EQ before tweaking specific EQ

##### Panning

* Remember that panning automation is almost as important as volume automation. Make it more stereo in the most important parts.
* Kick/snare/bass/vocal in the centre.
* you can smear/widen a part left and right by sidechaining with a < 30ms delay panned opposite.
* Check the mix in mono to verify it will sound ok in the real world. Correct lost parts with volume and EQ.
* Widen the drum overheads during the most excited parts of the track.

##### Volume

* Ride faders to emphasise different parts or e.g. stop a vocal note/phrase being lost under instruments.
* Work in 3dB steps to make audible differences.
* Automate drum overheads up during more energetic parts.
* Ensure volume balance is right before you turn to effects.

##### Reverb

* Use an ambient room reverb as a glue for tracks you want to push back in the mix, with lots of early reflections (which tell the ear how far away something is)
* use a 2nd room reverb to bring specific tracks forward, with lots of late reflection (which tells the ear what the room sounds like)
* cut lows and highs from the reverb to clean up mud and splash

##### Compression

* Try serial compression with multiple light compressors with different attack/release to separate transients and shape smoothly

##### EQ

* Consider a light High Pass Filter on every track to remove mud. If you can notice the effect thinning the mix, it's too much.
* EQ in mono to better separate frequencies. Not everyone will listen in stereo.
* Cut (subtractive EQ) rather than boost. Removes rather than boosts noise and adds headroom. Forces you to remove the bad rather than masking the bad with louder goods.
* The "pain frequency" at 2k sounds great in the mix but can be uncomfortable for listeners. This is the range for vocal intelligibility - cut 2k from midrange instruments to leave room for vocals.
* Be aware of [equal loudness curves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal-loudness_contour) and EQ accordingly. Human hearing is most sensitive at 2k-5k Hz and lowend particularly suffers at low volume, so balance the lowend in the mix at the loudest comfortable/normal volume and expect it to roll off at lower volume.
